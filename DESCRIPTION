Version: 0.3.0
Title: Retrieve Area Boundaries and Data from the ONS Open Geography Portal
Description: The main function of this package is to download area boundaries
    (in GeoJSON format) using the ONS Open Geography API, for all sub-areas - at a
    specified level - within a specified area. The main script will return a data
    frame with the sub-area geometry as an `sf` object ready to be visualised as a
    map. Initially just for areas within England and Wales, with a hope to add
    Scottish geographies at a later date.
