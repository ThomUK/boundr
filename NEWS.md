# jogger 0.1.3

* Further improvements to documentation
* Wrote a few tests for build_api_query()
* Package builds OK
* Not all examples are working, not sure what the cause is
* Refactored and tidied up misc small parts of scripts


# jogger 0.1.2

* Amended `geo_get()` to be the main function - copied params documentation over from create_custom_lookup()
* Fixed various build errors mostly to do with namespace
* Realised that utils::URLencode() isn't vectorised so rewrote build_api_query() process to account for that
* Removed examples where no longer accurate (params have shifted)
* TODOs from 0.1.1 remain


# jogger 0.1.1

* Sorted out Imports in DESCRIPTION file
* check() package and build documentation
* TODO: document internal package data
* TODO: work on README
* TODO: examples


# jogger 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
