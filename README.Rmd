### Retrieve area boundaries and data from the ONS Open Geography Portal

`boundr` was previously
[`jogger`](https://github.com/francisbarton/jogger).

The main purpose of this package is to download area lookups and
boundaries (in GeoJSON format) using the ONS Open Geography API, for all
areas at a specified level within a specified area.

The structure of the project looks a bit like this:

    bounds() [main UI function]
       ^
       |
       |
        <-------  create_lookup_table()
       |                ^
       |                |
       |                 <--------- return_query_data()
       |                |
       |                 <--------- pull_lookup_query_url() 
       |                                       \
       |                                        \
        <-------  return_bounds_data()           <----- opengeo_schema [data]
                        ^                       /              ^
                        |                      /               |
                         <--------  pull_geo_query_url()       |
                                                               |
                                                         build_schema()

The main script will return a data frame with the sub-area geometry
column, as an `sf` object ready to be visualised as a map.
