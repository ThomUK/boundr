### Retrieve area boundaries and data from the ONS Open Geography Portal

The main function of this package is to download area boundaries
  (in GeoJSON format) using the ONS Open Geography API, for all sub-areas - at a
  specified level - within a specified area.
The main script will return a data frame with the sub-area geometry column,
  as an `sf` object ready to be visualised as a map.
Initially just for areas within England and Wales, with a hope to add
  Scottish geographies at a later date.
And currently just for the following area levels:
  LSOA, MSOA, Ward, LAD/LTLA, UTLA, CAUTH, RGN _[subject to change]_
  
_Changes since 2019 (currently -- Nov 2020 -- just the change in Buckinghamshire from two-tier to unitary) are not yet incorporated._
