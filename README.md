# boundr

### Retrieve area boundaries and data from the ONS Open Geography Portal

`boundr` was previously
[`jogger`](https://github.com/francisbarton/jogger).

The main purpose of this package is to download area lookups and
boundaries (in GeoJSON format) using the ONS Open Geography API, for all
areas at a specified level within a specified area.

The main script will return a data frame with the sub-area geometry
column, as an `sf` object ready to be visualised as a map.

### Package logic

The structure of the project looks a bit like this:

    bounds() [main UI function]
       ^
       |
       |
        <-------  create_lookup_table()
       |                ^
       |                |
       |                 <--------- return_query_data()
       |                |
       |                 <--------- return_lookup_query_info() 
       |                                       \
       |                                        \
        <-------  return_bounds_data()           <----- opengeo_schema [data]
                        ^                       /              ^
                        |                      /               |
                         <--------  pull_geo_query_url()       |
                                                               |
                                                         build_schema()

When you call `bounds()` you specify a lower level area (eg ward) and a
higher level area (eg local authority), and you specify either the name
of the higher level area (or areas) or its code.

`return_lookup_query_info()` then finds the API query URL of a suitable
lookup table - one that contains columns for both your lower and higher
level areas. It does this by filtering `opengeo_schema`, which is a
cached copy of the various datasets available from the Open Geography
API Services list. This schema is available as internal data in the
package - but may need updating.

`create_lookup_table()` then builds a lookup table (a tibble) based on
all the areas you have said you are interested in. At the same time,
`return_bounds_data()` will - if you have specified you want spatial
boundaries data for your areas - retrieve the boundary data at your
chosen resolution for your lower level areas. These will then be joined
onto the lookup table and provided to you as an `sf` tibble.
